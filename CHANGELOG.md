# Changelog

All NotArc releases are on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Donnadieu/notarc/releases). Apple Silicon, macOS 13
or later. From 0.5.0 on, NotArc updates itself.

## Unreleased
- Easels: File > New Easel or the + menu adds a canvas to Today. File > Capture to Easel (Cmd+Shift+2) drops a
  picture of the page you're on into your latest easel, linked back to the page (double-click it to open). Double-click
  the canvas to add text; drag things around; Delete removes them. Easels are saved on your Mac and archive like tabs.

## 0.14.0
- Notes: File > New Note (Cmd+Ctrl+N) or the + menu adds a rich-text note to the top of Today. It is named from
  its first line, saved on your Mac as you type, and archived when closed like a tab. Format menu: bold, italic,
  underline, size, fonts and lists.
- Boosts: a Boost button in the address pill (filled and tinted when the site has a Boost on); Option-click while
  zapping hides every element like it; Shuffle picks a random colour and font.

## 0.13.0
- Boosts: customise any site (View > Boost This Site..., Cmd+Opt+B): tint its colours, change the font, text size
  and case, zap elements you don't want (View > Zap Element), and add your own CSS and JavaScript. Boosts are saved
  on your Mac and apply to the site and its subdomains every time a page loads; turn one off from the View menu.
- Light and dark: each Space can follow macOS or be set to Light or Dark (Space menu > Appearance), and the
  sidebar, rows, pills and command bar switch to Arc's light or dark colours with it.
- Arc motion: the sidebar slides sideways when you switch Spaces (from the right for the next Space, from the left
  for the previous one), and the page card pops in when you change tabs. Both turn off with Reduce Motion.
- Arc-style command bar: a rounded translucent card, Arc's text colours, the selected suggestion as an Arc-blue
  pill, an icon for each kind of suggestion, and a hairline under the field.

## 0.12.0
- Arc's window look: no title bar, the page sits in a rounded card inset on the Space colour, and the Space theme
  colours the whole window frame. The sidebar is 273 pt wide, as in Arc. Hiding the sidebar or Focus Mode shows
  the page edge to edge.
- Arc's sidebar top: sidebar toggle, back, forward and reload beside the window buttons, and a 36 pt address pill
  showing the site, with Copy URL and Site Settings buttons. Click the pill to open the command bar.
- Arc-style sidebar rows: 36 pt rounded pills with Arc's selected, hover and multi-select colours (and a soft
  shadow on the selected tab in light mode); Pinned and Today headers are plain labels and tabs under them aren't
  indented.
- Arc's bottom bar: Archive at the left, one icon per Space (its emoji, or a dot) to switch Spaces, and a "+"
  menu for New Tab, New Folder and New Space. Hidden with only one Space, as in Arc.
- Arc's Space title row replaces the Space drop-down: the Space's icon and name (double-click to rename) and a
  "..." menu with Rename, Edit Theme Color, Change Space Icon, New Space and Delete Space.
- Folders open and close with a single click and show a chevron instead of the macOS triangle; rows darken while
  pressed; a hairline separates Pinned from Today, as in Arc.
- New "Look and feel" section on the parity checklist.
- The self-test runs hidden and never takes focus.

## 0.11.0
- Site prompts: NotArc asks before a site uses your camera, microphone, location, notifications, clipboard and more,
  with "Remember for this site". Links that open other apps (email, Zoom, ...) ask "Open <App>?" first.
- Site Settings (View > Site Settings..., Cmd+Shift+I): connection security, Ask/Allow/Block per permission, Clear
  Cookies and Refresh, Reset Permissions.
- PDFs open in the built-in viewer, now covered by the self-test.

## 0.10.0
- Command bar suggestions: open and pinned tabs in any Space, Spaces, history, menu commands and top sites; picks rank
  higher next time.
- Toolbar mode (View > Show Toolbar, Cmd+Shift+S) with the full editable address; View > Hide Space Header.
- Undo after closing a Peek (toast, Cmd+Z, File > Reopen Closed Peek).
- Little Window: Move to Space menu.

## 0.9.0
- Crashed tabs show a Reload view; frozen pages get a Page Unresponsive sheet (Wait or Exit Page).
- Session restore: each Space reopens on its last tab; after a crash or force-quit, open tabs are reloaded.
- Sidebar multi-select with bulk actions; New Nested Folder.

## 0.8.0
